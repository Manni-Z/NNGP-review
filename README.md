Fig. 2 through Fig. 6 use R to do the simulation and plot. The detailed explanations and parameters are in the comments sesstion with the .r documents. 

The data of Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 are generated using the method proposed by 

Lee, J., Bahri, Y., Novak, R., Schoenholz, S., Pennington, J., Sohl-Dickstein, J. (2018). Deep Neural Networks as Gaussian Processes. ArXiv, abs/1711.00165.

You can find there code at

If anyone wants to run the code and get the data for Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 himself, additional to their codes, the .py listed will help do the work.
